This was my first prediction model. 
I was asked if I would like to try my Python skills in a real-world context. 

This is the background information I recieved.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
We run an ice cream store. Our sales are hugely dependent on weather conditions and the date of the week. 
In summary; 
•	Best for sale is a sunny, warm day on the weekend or a public holiday.
•	worst for sales is a cold, rainy, windy weekday.
•	Usually, we are open 6 days per week. 
THEIR GOAL
They produce ice cream freshly each day, so it is important for us to forecast the predicted sales for each day as exact as possible, based on the weather forecast for the week ahead. 

HOW HE HAS DONE THIS FORECAST SO FAR
He has summarised their actual sales data as well as the actual data for Frankfurt in the attached datasheet. Within the Excel sheet, he has experimented to see the correlation between the relevant factors and has built himself a little model (just a formula) to forecast predicted sales using weather forecasts and weekday/public holidays as input.

MY TASK

YOUR TASK (JOB)
Kirlin, your task is to do a better job than him, and develop a model, ideally in Python, that forecasts future sales based on weather data more accurately than his model. 
He will backtest your analysis using the actual data to see just how exact the prediction could become and compare your model to the ones that others are doing. 
His model in Excel has an r2 of 0.70 while others had somewhere 0.55, but the goal is to make it better than 0.70.


DEADLINE
There is no specified deadline, but it would be good if you could return the results within 3-4 weeks. 

I begun in March 27 and completed April 27.

I included a documentation of the project in the PYTHON PROJECT all trained models.ipynb
